## **Understanding Algorithms and Flowcharts**  
### **Introduction:**  
An **algorithm** is a step-by-step set of instructions to solve a problem. Before we write code, we often use **flowcharts** to visually represent these steps. This makes it easier to understand and communicate the logic behind a solution.

### **Key Concepts:**  
1. **What is an algorithm?** â€“ A set of well-defined instructions.  
2. **Flowchart symbols and their meanings.**  
3. **Decision making in algorithms (IF-ELSE conditions).**  
4. **Loops and repetition in algorithms.**  

### **Example:**  
**Algorithm for checking if a number is even or odd:**  
1. Start  
2. Input a number  
3. If the number is divisible by 2, print "Even"  
4. Else, print "Odd"  
5. End  

**Flowchart Representation:**  
ðŸŸ¢ **Start** â†’ ðŸ”· **Input Number** â†’ ðŸ”² **Check If Number % 2 == 0** â†’ â¬œ "Even" / "Odd" â†’ ðŸ”´ **End**

## Questions
1. **What makes an algorithm efficient, and why does efficiency matter?**  

    Because it a set of instruction that carefully planned before execution. To avoid wasting resources like time, energy and cost

2. **What are the key differences between an algorithm and a program?**  

    Algorithm focus on the logical steps to solve a problem, while program are practical applications of those algorithms. Therefore we can say if program is an implementation of a algorithm

3. **How would you design an algorithm to find the shortest path between two locations?**  

    Using djikstra algorithm

4. **Can you think of an everyday task that can be represented as an algorithm? How would you write it?**  

    While going to the field. 
    1. Set up the bike
    2. Turn right
    3. Go straight ahead
    4. Turn left
    5. Turn Right
    6. Turn Right 
    7. Go straight ahead
    8. Turn left
    9. Go straight ahead
    10. Finish 

5. **What are the main components of a flowchart, and how do they help in understanding algorithms?**  

    The main components is symbol, it helps to directing what to do next 

6. **Find two different flowcharts for sorting numbers and compare their effectiveness.**  

    1. Bubble sort algorithm flowchart
    2. Merge sort algorithm flowchart

    effectiveness:
    - Bubble sort is simpler but less efficient
    - Merge sort is more complex but more efficient
    - Bubble sorts use less memory than merge sort

7. **Why is decision-making (IF-ELSE conditions) important in algorithms?**  

    Because it determine what to do next if a condition true and false

8. **How would you modify a simple algorithm to handle unexpected errors or conditions?**  

    By evaluate the mistake and checking if the modification will have a bad impact for the rest of the algorithm

9. **What are the differences between linear and non-linear algorithms? Provide examples.**  

    (answer here)

10. **How can flowcharts help in debugging and understanding software systems?**  

    Since software consist of computer program that instruct the execution of a computer and program is an implementation of algorithm, therefore we can determine wether the program complies with the algorithm
