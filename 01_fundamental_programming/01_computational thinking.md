## **Introduction to Computational Thinking**  
### **Introduction:**  
Computers are powerful because they can solve complex problems quickly, but they don’t "think" like humans. **Computational thinking** helps us break down problems so that computers can understand and process them efficiently. Learning to **think like a programmer** will make it easier to understand coding later.  

### **Key Concepts:**  
1. **Decomposition** – Breaking a large problem into smaller, manageable parts.  
2. **Pattern Recognition** – Finding similarities between problems.  
3. **Abstraction** – Ignoring irrelevant details to focus on the main problem.  
4. **Algorithm Design** – Creating step-by-step solutions.  

### **Example:**  
Think about making a cup of coffee. What are the steps?  
- Boil water  
- Add coffee powder  
- Pour water into the cup  
- Stir and serve  

This is an **algorithm** because it follows a **logical sequence of steps**.  

## **Questions**  
1. **What is computational thinking, and why is it important for programmers?**  

    It is a process of creating solution by breaking down a problem into its separate pars and discovering the effective steps that reliably and effectively resolve the problem. To help programmer solve a problem while facing a problem

2. **How do engineers and software developers use decomposition to solve problems?**  

    When they face a problem, they will break down the problem into small parts and then solve the problem

3. **What are some real-world examples where pattern recognition is applied in technology?**  

    Using Bluetooth to connect mouse, keyboard and transfer data to avoid cable mess

4. **Why is abstraction necessary when designing a solution? Can you give an example from daily life?**  

    Because if we got distracted while solving a problem, the problem will never solved. 
    When there is a leak on the roof, the main focus is to patching the roof not decorating it. 

5. **What is the difference between an algorithm and a process?**  

    Algorithm refers specifically to a set of instructions or rules used to solve a problem or a complete a task, while process can refer to broader series of steps or actions taken to achieve a goal.

    Process is often more flexible and adaptable than algorithm, which tends to be more rigid and structured

    Algorithm is commonly used in mathematics and computer science, while process used in a variety of fields, including manufacturing, business, and healthcare

6. **How do computers follow instructions differently than humans?**  

    Because computers operate based on binary logic and doesn't have intuition, while the other side human was born with intuition and ability to interpret vague instruction

7. **What are some common mistakes people make when writing instructions for others?**  

    1. Non-sequential instruction
    2. Too broad instruction
    3. Unspecific purpose

8. **How can algorithmic thinking be applied in fields outside of computer science?**  

    By learning about algoritmic thinking as early as possible and make it a habits

9. **Why do some problems require multiple solutions instead of a single best solution?**  

    Because it is a critical and complex problem

10. **How can you improve your problem-solving skills to think like a software engineer?**  

    With applying computational thinking to solve every problem
